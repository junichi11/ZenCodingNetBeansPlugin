OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Emmet \u2014 the essential toolkit for web-developers\n\nBasically, most text editors out there allow you to store and re-use commonly used code chunks, called \u201csnippets\u201d. \
    While snippets are a good way to boost your productivity, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define the snippet first and you can\u2019t extend them in runtime.\n\n\
    Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation. \
    Emmet is developed and optimised for web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be used with programming languages too.\n\n\
